          <h2>The Process</h2>

          <p>
            The work behind Mate Rate has been following the Double Diamond
            Design and Goal-directed design, to make sure to deliver the perfect
            social-food community platform of reviews! The process can be
            summarized using 4 phases.
          </p>
          <h2>Discover</h2>
          <p>
            The discover phase started kicked-off our project helping us to
            understand, rather than assuming, a problem that needs to be
            targeted. Several sessions of brainstorming were conducted to decide
            on the initial idea which we named “Friend’s tips for
            restaurants/bars/hotels”. This was then followed by gathering of
            knowledge and facts as we dug deep into previous research and
            learned about the history and critique of online reviews, along the
            impact of social media communities? This all led up to a broader
            problem statement ready to be further analyzed. To get to know the
            people affected by the problematic issue, we started to gather
            initial insights through semi-structured interviews and product
            reviews of similar applications. Through all data collection, we
            could now move on to further analysis and definitions.
          </p>

          <h2>Define</h2>
          <p>
            Data from the discovery phase was analyzed using a thematic
            analysis, to translate insights, knowledge and facts into more
            concrete requirements and definitions. We created personas to guide
            the analysis and really illustrate our targeting group. Through
            analysis, we were able to narrow down, define and concretize our
            ideas, which was summarized through user pain-points, user needs and
            user goals. As we now began to understand more of the context of the
            problem, we were ready to start creating a more concrete concept. A
            customer journey mapping and storyboarding was done to lay out
            further requirements, design principles and frameworks to be used.
          </p>

          <h2>Develop</h2>
          <p>
            Based on the layout and definition from the previous phase, we
            created a hi-fi prototype in Figma to display the actual application
            and effectively communicate and explain our idea, concept and user
            flow. After the prototype building, we moved on to evaluation of our
            prototype. We gathered potential users, half of them in a focus
            group and half of them individually, to perform usability testing.
            We encourage users to verbally express their thoughts and ideas
            through Think Aloud usability testing along with providing them with
            Tasked Based Scenarios to really understand the needed improvement
            for our design and application. After the different features and
            functionalities were tested, we gained valuable insights on
            adjustments, to really create a product aligning with user goals and
            directing our problem statement.
          </p>

          <h2>Deliver</h2>
          <p>
            To wrap up our project, we entered the delivery phase after grouping
            and categorizing our findings for our prototype evaluation. We
            thereby began our second iteration of our hi-fi prototype, creating
            changes based on key takeaways from the previous phase. To finalize
            the project we built a demo version of the app using React Native,
            Google’s API for Maps and Firebase. After some final adjustments
            were made, we could display our final delivery.
            <br /><br />Reflecting on our project and progress has been an
            important last step, in order to improve until next time. A mistake
            is only a mistake if you don't learn from it, so that’s why we went
            through our project and chose methods to learn and reflect.
