          <h2>What is Mate Rate?</h2>
          <p>
            To put it short, Mate Rate is a trustworthy social community of
            accurate reviews. The application combines the simplicity of
            standardized reviews with trust in your friends, to create a network
            of a social-food community where one can share restaurant
            recommendations with one another. The mission with Mate Rate can be
            summarized using the following two sentences: “Mate Rate should help
            users navigate and explore new restaurants or bars perfectly
            tailored to their situational preferences. This should be done
            through a trustworthy social community of accurate reviews in a
            simple and efficient way.”

          <h2>Why Mate Rate?</h2>
          <p>
            Mate Rate targets two important problems when it comes to getting
            recommendations. The first one being:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The problem of online reviews</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Finding good recommendations are difficult and time-consuming
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most reviews online are inaccurate, irrelevant or a direct
                  mismatch with own preferences
                </li>
                <li>Too much and messy information available online</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The problem of communicating with friends</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Being reliant on your friends availability to answer</li>
                <li>
                  Risk of chats disappearing when asking for recommendations for
                  long-term purposes
                </li>
                <li>
                  The lack of a standardized and easy way of communicating
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
