          <h2>The Product</h2>
          <p>
            To keep the design as simple as possible, we have created 3
            different views for the user, with different functions. We call
            these views - The Map View, The Social View and The Profile View.
          </p>
          <span class="usps"><img src="images/product_icons.png" /></span>
          <p>
            Now, you might wonder, what are the different views? What do they
            do? And why are they helpful for me? Don’t you worry, we explain
            everything below, to get you started and easy understanding of Mate
            Rate.
          </p>
          <h2>The Map View</h2>
          <h3>The map</h3>
          <span class="video">
            <video width="320" , height="240" controls>
              <source src="videos/map.mov" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
          </span>
          <p>
            With Mate Rate, it all comes down to the map. This is the place
            where all of your friend’s reviews are stored in one single place!
            You can explore the places your friends have visited and read more
            about them just by pressing on a friendly face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the map, you can easily explore recommendations through a
            simple and easy overview of recommendations.
          </p>
          <h3>Display a review</h3>
          <p>
            By pressing on a recommendation, you can gather more specific
            information from your friend's review. It will include ratings from
            1-5 from your friend regarding the price, food, service, including
            both an average rating from the specific friend and overall rating
            with these categories combined. Furthermore you will be able to see
            a comment with more specific information and tags to help you grasp
            the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            An easy layout with not too much information, displaying only the
            necessary things you need to know for digging into the details of a
            recommendation of a place. This all to help you really grasp and
            understand the vibe and content of the place.
          </p>
          <h3>Filters</h3>
          <p>ADD VIDEO OF FILTERS</p>
          <p>
            Through the filter, you can choose to filter out what is shown on
            the map based on friends, types or areas. If you are looking for
            something specific, you know that there is one friend that always
            has great burger recommendations, or if you are not interested in a
            particular type of place, you can always just use the filter
            function to find this out!
          </p>
          <p>
            The filter helps you to not get overwhelmed with information and to
            make sure you get recommendations matched to your individual
            specific preference.
          </p>
          <h3>Add review</h3>
          <span class="video">
            <video width="320" , height="240" controls>
              <source src="videos/add_review.mov" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
          </span>
          <p>
            You can either add a location through 1) searching for a place, 2)
            get location on the map or 3) import it from social media. After
            selecting your place, just rate your experience based on categories,
            add a small comment, choose a fun icon and tags relatable to your
            recommendation. You can also add a picture, since one is always
            “eating with the eye”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you bored and don’t have the time and energy to write long
            reviews? Don’t worry, you don’t have to do that at Mate Rate, we got
            you covered in an easy and simple way! We have made it simple using
            our 3 selections for adding a review, and a simple and fun interface

            simple and fun! We usually say that it is Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

          <p>
            If you are not quite finding what you are looking for on the map,
            you can always send a request to a friend. You can specify what type
            of place you are looking for, who you want to send the review to,
            and then write a message about what you are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get in touch with your friends in a short and easy way, and request
            reviews based on your preferences to match your individual specific
            mood for the day! Maybe you have a friend who has a killer
            restaurant for your craving for pizza? Then just send out a request

            The app is built with React Native, making it available for both iOS
            and Android with only one codebase. We used a serverless backend
            with Firebase, enabling user authentication and data storage without
            having to build a new backend server. The map view is generated with
            help of Google’s Maps API.
